# android init

## boot sequence

early-init, init, early-boot, boot

early-init -> init -> early-boot -> boot


1. property\_get works, but may have random issues. (have not checked yet)  
2. getenv doesn’t work in init itself. Process forked in init also doesn’t work.


system/core/init/property\_service.c
    load_properties_from_file(PROP_PATH_SYSTEM_BUILD);
        property_set()

It will read property file from /system/build.prop and set them.
